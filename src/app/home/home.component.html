                        <p>Scaffolding explores new methods of teaching the basic principles of programming. This phase focuses
                            on linear problem solving and is supported by programming lab assignments (PLAs) during term
                            time. Scaffolding data can be revealing of how well a student is grasping the taught concepts
                            and to help teachers assess areas that require improvement.

                        <h2>Discovery</h2>
                        <p>Discovery involves open or guided, non-linear problem-based learning with exploration to solve requirements.
                            Discovery is encouraged with project work that forces students to independently
                            research and consider alternatives to develop and evaluate their solutions.
                            This is an iterative design approach based on prior experiences.
